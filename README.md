- 🖥️ Few of my proj
> I have a habit of making small projects that I end up using on a daily basis <br>
> [Battery Tracker](https://github.com/HimaSava/Laptop_Battery_Logger "Battery Logger") : It logs ur laptop battery percentage into a csv file. <br> Its fun to see the battery discharge and recharge over time <br>
> [Bit Plane Encoding](https://github.com/HimaSava/Bit-plane_Coder "Image Coder") : It hides any file into a image. Its super sneaky, you cannot <br> tell the difference in the image. It also has a decoder. Send super coded images to ur friends 🔐 <br>
> [Work Tracker](https://github.com/HimaSava/Work_Tracker "Work Tracker") : Helps u track ur daily activity. It saves all ur data in a csv.  The <br> way I see it, it is a tool that lets u do data mining on yourself 😆
